Every night in my dreams
I see you
I feel you
That is how I know you
Go on
Far cross the distance
And spcaces between us
You have come to show you
Go on
Near
Far
Wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once 
More
You open the door
And you're here in my heart and
My Heart will go on and on
